### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profolio!

- ðŸ”­ My name is Jin and I recently graduated with a Master of Data Science from Durham University. I am passionate about exploring the exciting world of data and all the possibilities it holds!

- ðŸ˜Ž On my Github page, you'll find a range of projects - some from my academic journey and others outside of my studies. I am dedicated to continuously expanding my skills and knowledge in Data Science and keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies. That's why I make sure to upload at least one project every two weeks! 

- ðŸŒ± I am currently looking for opportunities to collaborate on Data Science projects, and I am also seeking a job in the field. If you're interested in working with me, feel free to reach out at jinhuang678@gmail.com. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together!

- ðŸ“« If you are interested you can reach me: jinhuang678@gmail.com
